Andrews later took a job at Rich’s, after he worked at Aidmore Hospital and Emile’s French Cafe (131), working “in the kitchen of the (white) employees’ cafeteria . . . it was above the Magnolia Tea Room . . . where all the colored help worked dressed like Hattie McDaniel and fellow slaves in Gone With The Wind” (163) . Rich’s had a segregated dining room for its customers and a separate cafeteria for its black employees while Andrews worked there. Inasmuch, Rich’s would not hire Val, Andrews’ sister, “because she didn’t look ‘maidish,’ or ‘colored enough’” (145).

Thanking the man, I got out of the truck and stood on the sidewalk in front of the YMCA staring up at it . . . It happened more than once that someone from some small Georgia town would migrate to Atlanta and discover the Butler Street Y, return home and spread the word, or 'preach the gospel,' about it, The Avenue, and the city to his peers. Thus forming an underground railroad, or 'Greyhound Highway,' from that specific town to the Butler Street Y” (17, 62). The Butler Street Y became a sort of safe haven for big city opportunities for many rural-born, young ,black men.

In walking past these houses I happened to glance to my left and directly into an open window of one” (104). Through the window, he saw a white woman looking into a mirror, putting on lipstick. Andrews describes this woman as very beautiful, with long, dark hair, “wearing no blouse, or top . . . nor brassiere” (104). Andrews froze, but the woman smiled at him, looking straight into his eyes. Andrews acknowledges that a “deep down fear of this being a ‘white’ woman and I knew I had better not get caught ‘looking’ at a naked one or I was as good as dead” (104). Even as a teenager, Andrews understood how the South guards the purity and sanctity of Southern white womanhood."

Many years earlier Decatur Street was filled with black whorehouses while right around the corner on Courtland Street were the white whorehouses. The black and white pimps often got together to swap samples. Yet by 1950 Decatur Street had tamed down considerably but still had its ‘spots,’ along with its ‘sin street’ reputation” (156).

But most of all Hunter Street was known for its colored homes and the farther out this street one travelled the nicer were the houses” (159). Among these nicer homes was the house that belonged to Graham Jackson, “the black Navy Chief Petty Officer pictured in Life Magazine crying while playing the accordion on the day after the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt when the body was carried to the train at Warm Springs, Georgia, where he died on April 12, 1945” (159). Hunter Street was renamed to Martin Luther King Jr. Dive in the 1970s.
