The space had a gallery as well as studios and, like other organizations in the late 1970s, benefited from the city's Bureau of Cultural Affairs (that granted funds from the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act-CETA), the Georgia Arts Council, and other public funding agencies. Located in a then largely African American neighborhood, the mostly white consortium was, in the late seventies, the focus of community consternation when, according to its Neighborhood Planning Unit, it did not fulfill a mandate to be a place for community activity. In the 1984, the Forrest Avenue consortium became the Nexus Contemporary Art Center (now the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center). Annette Cone-Skelton and JoAnne Paschall, artists and art adminstrators at the time, remember the activities and energy of the consortium.\n<br>\n<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/134719989@N04/20555461181/in/datetaken/\" title=\"nexus\"><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5638/20555461181_1632815dc1_n.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"255\" alt=\"nexus\"></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<br>\nThe Zuckerman Museum of Art commissioned Emily J.

As a consiously feminist organization, it served as a place for women artists to exhibit, network with artists around the country, participate in workshops, and gain arts administration experience. Exhibitions, such as \"36 Women Artists\" and \"Mappings: A Survey of Atlanta Women Artists,\" supported the work of local women in the arts scene. The WAC ceased operations in the early 1990s, though some of its early members continue to be active in the Women's Caucus for Art in Georgia. Julia A. Fenton and Callahan McDonough, both founding members of the collective, describe the early activities of the WAC.\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.callahanmcdonough.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Atlanta-Womens-Art-Collective-1.jpg\"/>\n<br>\nEarly members of the collective.

It supported local artists through a slide registry program, library, and gallery space. Members also published the Atlanta Art Workers Coalition Newspaper, which offered reviews of area shows, critical takes on the local art scene, interviews with nationally and internationally known artists, and reports on funding. The AAWC also published a directory of area artists. The organization folded in 1983. Julia A. Fenton, who served as executive director of the AAWC for a time, describes the beginnings of the organization. JoAnne Paschall speaks more broadly to a changing attitude among young artists of the 1970s who wanted to reassess and even overturn traditional conventions of the art world. \n<br>\n<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/134719989@N04/20360921740/in/datetaken/\" title=\"art_workers\"><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5764/20360921740_5e8e26ef88_n.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"257\" alt=\"art_workers\"></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<br>\nThe Zuckerman Museum of Art commissioned Emily J.

Created in 1975, the NAC was part of the Black Arts movement of the 1960s and 1970s and tied to the cultural politics of Black Power. Community members attended workshops, lectures, classes, exhibits, and performances led by actors, visual artists, musicians, artisans, and poets. Tina Dunkley was an artist-in-residence and Alice Lovelace was a writer-in-residence, both during the late 1970s; both were funded by the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), a jobs program signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973. The NAC remained vital long after the early 1980s and the removal of CETA funds, and closed in 1990. The schoolbuilding burned in 1986, after the NAC had moved to a new location on Auburn Avenue. Alice Lovelace and Tina Dunkley share histories with and opinions on the NAC. \n<br>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/134892626\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br>\nSeveral ATLas interviewees remembered that artists perceived the NAC to be the city's \"black\" arts center and the Forrest Avenue Consortium to be a \"white\" art space.

Correspondence during this period between members of the Atlanta Art Workers Coalition suggests, however, that some young artists saw the High as inaccessible and \"stuffy\" and that artist-initiated organizations and exhibitions were the antidote to a hiearchical art world of which the High was a part.\n<br>\n<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/134719989@N04/20548968475/in/datetaken/\" title=\"The Avant-Garde: 12 in Atlanta\"><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5703/20548968475_7236127cfd_n.jpg\" width=\"277\" height=\"320\" alt=\"The Avant-Garde: 12 in Atlanta\"></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<br>\n<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/134719989@N04/20540078122/in/datetaken/\" title=\"&quot;Foreword&quot; in &quot;Avant-Garde: 12 in Atlanta&quot;\"><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5771/20540078122_6aeb69315a_n.jpg\" width=\"277\" height=\"320\" alt=\"&quot;Foreword&quot; in &quot;Avant-Garde: 12 in Atlanta&quot;\"></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<br>\nCover and Gudmund Vigtel foreword for \"The Avante-Garde: 12 in Atlanta\" exhibition catalogue.

Jackson aspired to make Atlanta an international city, and part of that plan was a robust arts scene. To that end, he created the Bureau of Cultural Affairs to fund and organize the arts, and launched other initiatives (such as his Mayor's Week for the Arts) to bring attention to the variety of arts organizations in the city. Jackon can also be credited for bringing artists to the city--both Tina Dunkley and Alice Lovelace came to Atlanta after seeing advertising campaigns during Jackson's reign that touted Atlanta as the seat of a \"New South,\" an image expressly aimed at African Americans. In the 1974 New York Times article referenced by Tina Dunkley (\"Capital of Black-is-Bountiful\") author Peter Ross Range confirmed that Jackson's election \"was widely hailed as the triumph of the black middle class.\" Dunkley, Alice Lovelace, and Louise Shaw remember the importance of Jackson in their own career paths and for the city of Atlanta."
