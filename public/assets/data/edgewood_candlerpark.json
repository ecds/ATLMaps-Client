Over the next two decades she boldly sold lots to African American families. Plat and county maps from 1893, 1915, 1941 name the African American property owners in the Subdivision. Antioch East members, property deeds, US Census and Atlanta City Directories offer details about the Black residents.

Atlanta City Council passed the 1942 Slum Clearance Ordinance, facilitating citywide removal of selected homes lacking plumbing and needing repair. This paved the way for the City’s acquisition of all the residences in the Mayson Ave. Subdivision in the 1940s and the incorporation of those properties into Candler Park.<br>biracialhistoryproject.org",

Once located at the intersection of today’s Candler Park Dr. and Miller Ave., the Edgewood Evening Star Lodge No. 1 was chartered in DeKalb County in 1892 as an association approved “for social and moral improvement, as well as for charity” and “the erection of a Lodge building.” An African American neighborhood institution within the Mayson Ave. Subdivision, the Lodge was built on land sold to it in 1893 for $1.00 by Subdivision residents Dan McNeal and Rev. Charles Weldon.<br><br> After Antioch East’s wooden church burned in 1916, the congregation met at the Evening Star Lodge until 1922, while building their Stone Church across the street. The Lodge had electricity, and as Elders recall, it was a two-story wooden structure where Lodge members and Boy Scouts would hold their meetings. City of Atlanta documents show the Lodge remained at this location in the Subdivision at least until 1930.<br><br> As self-governing bodies, African American Lodges served as outlets for Black leadership, where members could speak freely and find support for their ideas. Set up like a corporation, a lodge provided insurance, sick and death benefits to its members through subscriptions. During times of public resistance to the formation of Black businesses, the Lodge was one of the few platforms for Black entrepreneurs.<br><br>biracialhistoryproject.org",

                "description": "420 Oakdale Rd., now home to local historian Kelly Jordan, was the site of Antioch East’s first church building. Circa 1879, Antioch made a “brush harbor” here on 1/16 acre belonging to Pastor A.L. Bryan(t). DeKalb County real estate records show the 1883 purchase of this site (then on Bell St, later Whitefoord, now Oakdale Rd.) for $1.00 from “A. L. Bryan” by “Antioch Baptist Church of Edgewood.”  The deed states a church structure was on the site at that time.<br><br> According to Antioch East History and Elders, the wooden church they built here burned to the ground in 1916.  Details surrounding the fire are mysterious. Antioch sold the property to Sallie Miller in 1917. Kelly Jordan purchased the current house and property in 1984. The oldest existing foundation stones may have been supports for the original wooden church. We plan to research these stones with an Archaeological Society.<br><br> The early Edgewood community’s African American school was likely located in the church’s basement. The 1883 deed of sale to Antioch allowed “for church and school purposes only.” 1898-1908 City of Edgewood Council Minutes document the existence of a separate school for African American children in a basement on the north side of the RR tracks. The Edgewood Museum’s Commemorative Booklet also links Antioch with the early Black school on Bell St.<br><br>biracialhistoryproject.org",
