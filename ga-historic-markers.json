He acquired the land in 1861 from his father. Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century´s use of these grounds expanded to provide burial for members of various churches and fraternal lodges of the neighboring black community. These included the Sterling Chapel (founded in 1885 and later merged with Dodd United Methodist Church in 1973 to form the Dodd-Sterling United Methodist Church), Travelers´ Rest Baptist Church, Union Baptist Church, and the Queen of the South Lodge Free and Accepted Masons.\r\rThis memorial is dedicated to the memory of those individuals, known and unknown, here interred. Among those buried here, identified by family, friends and private records are those whose names are listed on the central monument. Pastors who are known to have participated in Services at Gilbert Cemetery include: A. M. Bridges; J. B. Greer; C. J. J. Johnson, D.D.; J.F. Shumake; B.B. Carter; T. W. Hobbs; E. D. Lumpkin; C.S. Stinson; R. Wilborn.\r\rGilbert Cemetery was destroyed by unknown persons in the late 1950´s. The Memorial Cemetery has been made possible through efforts of concerned local residents, local clergy, the Fulton County Superior Court, the Georgia Department of Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration and others, so that those laid to rest here would not be forgotten.\rTips for Finding This Marker: At the intersection of Cleveland Ave. and I-75 in Atlanta",

At the time, this building had neither fire escapes, fire doors, nor sprinklers. For two and a half hours, Atlanta fire fighters and others from nearby towns battled valiantly in the cold to save the majority of the 280 guests. But their ladders reached only to the eighth floor and their nets were not strong enough to withstand jumps of more than 70 feet. Therefore numerous guests died on the sidewalks and in the alley behind the building. Thirty of the 119 victims were among Georgia’s most promising high school students, who had come to Atlanta to attend the YMCA’s Youth Assembly at the Capitol. The Winecoff fire became the watershed event in fire safety. Within days, cities across America began enacting more stringent safety ordinances.

While building northward near Griffin, the Monroe RR accepted John Thrasher’s bid to build an embankment to enable a future junction of the Monroe RR with the W&amp;A RR. The Monroe Embankment, at $25,000 project, required about two years to complete. To fulfill his contract John Thrasher brought in many laborers, built rough shelters to house them and opened Atlanta’s first store. Atlanta’s first religious service, labor trouble, social event and baby are associated with this settlement. In 1847, the terminus was changed to the place now marked by the Zero Mile Post. Thrasherville, Terminus and Marthasville were the names given to the railroad generated settlement activity which preceded Atlanta. Thrasherville and Terminus were unofficial names; Marthasville was incorporated in 1843 and was reincorporated as Atlanta in 1845 and 1847. “Cousin John’s” settlement at this location is where Atlanta began.\rTips for Finding This Marker: In front of the Federal Reserve Bank at 104 Marietta St. NE in Atlanta",

With connections from Charleston, via Augusta, the old thoroughfare ran through this section to reach the Indian towns of present - day northwest Georgia. The Hightower Trail was once recognized as an early boundary between the Cherokee and Creek Indian Nations. The old road was used as the dividing line between Indian cessions of 1819 and 1821, and remains today as the Gwinnett - Dekalb boundary. After northwest Georgia was opened for settlement in 1832, numerous pioneers migrated over the old trace and many built their homes along it. The name of the trail is believed to come from the Cherokee, Ita - Wa, but the first English to visit this section pronounced and recorded the name as Hightower.

William T. Sherman set out from Atlanta on the March to the Sea, a military campaign designed to destroy the Confederacy’s ability to wage war and break the will of its people to resist. After destroying Atlanta’s industrial and business (but not residential) districts, Sherman’s 62,500 men marched over 250 miles, reaching Savannah in mid-December. Contrary to popular myth, Sherman’s troops primarily destroyed only property used for waging war – railroads, train depots, factories, cotton gins, and warehouses. Abandoning their supply base, they lived off the land, destroying food they could not consume. They also liberated thousands of enslaved African Americans in their path. Sherman’s “hard hand of war” demoralized Confederates, hastening the end of slavery and the reunification of the nation.\r\rErected for the Civil War 150 commemoration by the Georgia Historical Society and the Georgia Battlefields Association\rTips for Finding This Marker: In Freedom Park at the intersection of North Ave and Moreland Ave in Atlanta",

Following the mill's final closure in 1971, the residential community continued to thrive, maintaining many of the mill's working families.\r\rTips for Finding This Marker: In Whittier Mill Park, on Wales Avenue in Atlanta",

Four inconclusive battles occurred inside the present day I-285 Perimeter: Peachtree Creek (July 20), Atlanta (July 22, fought in part in the area of this marker), Ezra Church (July 28); and Utoy Creek (August 6). Unwilling to attack the city's strong defenses, U.S. forces swept west and then south and at Jonesboro (August 31-Sept. 1) cut the last railroad supplying Atlanta, forcing the Confederates to abandon the city. The fall of Atlanta on Sept. 2, 1864, assured the re-election of Abraham Lincoln and the final defeat of the Confederacy.\rErected for the Civil War 150 commemoration by the Georgia Historical Society, the Georgia Battlefields Association and the Georgia Department of Economic Development.\rTips for Finding This Marker: At 453 Freedom Parkway in Atlanta",

Marked graves in the cemetery date from the 1830s.\r\rFour church buildings have stood on this site: a little log cabin; a two-story wooden structure built by the members and destroyed by a cyclone; a third church building erected with the help of Sardis Lodge No. 107 F. &amp; A. M., who used the second floor as a meeting place; and the present edifice, built in the 1920s, in the style of 1812.Some on the church roll today are descendants of charter members. Four families have belonged for four generations and seven have been members for three generations.\rTips for Finding This Site: On Powers Ferry Rd. just north of Roswell Rd. in Atlanta",

Fort Peachtree occupied the summit northeast of the confluence of the Chattahoochee River and Peachtree Creek, and overlooked the Creek trading post town of Standing Peachtree. First Lt. George Rockingham Gilmer (Governor of Georgia, 1829-31, 1837-39) erected the fort in 1814. He later said he had \"never seen a fort\" up until that time, but as far as anyone knows, his construction was successful, since the strength of the fort was never tested. Sgt James McConnell Montgomery, one of Gilmer's command of twenty-two wrote Gen. Andrew Jackson (March 20, 1814) that the site, \"on a commanding eminence,\" provided a \"romantic\" view of the river, both up stream and down. In July he described the fort as being \"two large hew'd logg block houses, six dwelling houses, and one fram'd store house, one Bridge .. . and five boats\" which cost \"the Governor not less than five thousand dollars\". (Montgomery later returned to live here. He became postmaster of Standing Peachtree and established Montgomery's Ferry near the fort site.)

So quick was the crossing, the surprised and out-numbered Confederates were able to fire only a single cannon shot before withdrawing. J.D.

Stoneman, with three brigades (2112 men and 2 guns) of the Army of the Ohio cavalry, supported by Garrard's division, Army of the Cumberland cavalry, to cut the Central of Georgia R.R. by which the defenders [CSA] were supplied. On the 27th, Stoneman sent Garrard to Flat Rock (12 miles SE) to protect his rear, then left Decatur, crossed the Ocmulgee (Yellow) River near Covington, and turned down the left bank toward Monticello and Macon.\r\rNear Macon on the 30th, he detached part of the 14th Illinois Cavalry which wrecked railway facilities at Griswoldville, Gordon, McIntyre and Toomsboro (east of Macon), and burned trains, trestles and the long railway bridge over the Oconee River.\r\rAt Macon (95 miles SE), he was turned back by Georgia Militia, strongly intrenched. Unable to advance, he shelled Macon briefly, then attempted to retreat. Early next morning, Sunday the 31st, he was brought to bay at Sunshine Church (19 miles NE of Macon) by Brig. Gen. Alfred Iverson, Jr., who, with only 1300 cavalry, had marched to intercept him. Deluded into believing that he was being surrounded, Stoneman covered the escape northward of Adams' and Capron's brigades, then he surrendered, with about 600 men and his artillery and train, to what Iverson had managed to convince him was a substantially superior force.\rTips for Finding This Site: Old Courthouse in Decatur.",

Kenner Garrard, was in Decatur. His three brigades were scattered from Decatur to Roswell, guarding bridges over the Chattahoochee River and picketing the left flank. That night, Garrard was ordered to assemble his command and march to Covington (30 miles SE), to burn bridges over the Yellow and Ulcofauhachee (Alcovy) rivers and to destroy the railroad between Lithonia and the Alcovy.\rGarrard marched late on the 21st. He returned to Decatur on the 24th, after marching almost 90 miles. He destroyed 4 wagon bridges, 2 railroad bridges and more than 6 miles of track. At Covington, he burned the depot, a newly-built army hospital center, 2,000 bales of cotton, and large quantities of quartermaster and commissary supplies. Three trains were captured and burned.\r\rGarrard's raid cut off all communication between Atlanta and Augusta and destroyed any hope that the Army of Tennessee -- the hard-pressed defenders of Atlanta -- might receive supplies or reinforcements from the Eastern Confederacy; but this success was not without its price. Because of Garrard's absence from the Union left, Hardee's Corps was able to approach undetected and to launch his smashing blow at that unguarded flank which has passed into history as the Battle of Atlanta.\rTips for Finding This Marker: At the old courthouse in Decatur.",

It perished during the Civil War and was briefly revived from 1870 to 1872 in Atlanta. Thornwell Jacobs refounded the University as a private, non-sectarian liberal arts college at the present site in 1915. Land on Peachtree Road was donated by realtor C.H. Ashford. By 1929 Oglethorpe had acquired about 600 acres, including nearby Silver Lake, a gift from publisher William Randolph Hearst. The Gothic revival architecture on the campus was intended as a \"living memorial\" to Georgia's founder, James Edward Oglethorpe. It was inspired by his honorary alma mater, Corpus Christi College, Oxford, England. Four buildings of limestone and native granite, built before 1930, were designed by the noted firm of Morgan and Dillon. Phoebe Hearst Memorial Hall, Lupton Hall with its distinctive bell tower, Hermance Stadium and the Lowry Hall section of Philip Weltner Library are on the National Register of Historic Places. The Crypt of Civilization time capsule, a vault located in Hearst Hall, was sealed in 1940 and is not to be opened until 8113 A.D.\rTips for Finding This Site: 4484 Peachtree Road in Atlanta.",
